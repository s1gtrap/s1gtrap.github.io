[Demo](https://tan.ge/popeye-demo) | [Repo](https://github.com/s1gtrap/popeye)

Another demo/toy project intended for optimizing training programs for workout routines using graph colouring.

Written in Rust targeting WebAssembly using the Yew framework with the datasets loosely lifted/borrowed from https://exrx.net.

No real purpose other than demo'ing the use of graph colouring and its application in something other than register allocation.
