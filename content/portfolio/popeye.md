[Demo](https://tan.ge/popeye) | [Repo](https://github.com/s1gtrap/popeye)

A demo/toy project intended for optimizing training programs for workout routines using graph colouring. Although this uses Welsh-Powell instead of the linear time approximation known as coloring by simplification or linear scan as used in my bachelors thesis.

Written in Rust targeting WebAssembly using the Yew framework with the datasets loosely lifted/borrowed from https://exrx.net. It serves no real purpose other than demo'ing the use of graph colouring and its application in something other than register allocation.
