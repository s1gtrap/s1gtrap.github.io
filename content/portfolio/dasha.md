An x86 disassembler written in Rust with a demo targeting WebAssembly mostly intended as a demo/toy project linking assembly code to machine code generated.

Minimal utility in practice but it looks really cool to see specific parts of the machine code corresponding to associated assembly highlighted as you mouse over.
