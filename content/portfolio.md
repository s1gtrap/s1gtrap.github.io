#### Con^2

[Demo](https://tan.ge/con2) | [Repo (frontend)](https://github.com/s1gtrap/con2) | [Repo (backend)](https://github.com/s1gtrap/con2-api)

A minimum viable product enabling users to share pictures of nearby bus stops on a map for others to enjoy.

The backend consists of TypeScript using the fastify web framework, Postgres for data and Amazon S3 for media storage.

The frontend is written with TypeScript and React.

#### Dasha

[Demo](https://tan.ge/dasha-demo) | [Repo](https://github.com/s1gtrap/dasha)

An x86 disassembler written in Rust with a demo targeting WebAssembly mostly intended as a demo/toy project linking assembly code to machine code generated.

#### Popeye

[Demo](https://tan.ge/popeye-demo) | [Repo](https://github.com/s1gtrap/popeye)

Another demo/toy project intended for optimizing training programs for workout routines using graph colouring.

Written in Rust targeting WebAssembly with the Yew framework the datasets are loosely lifted from https://exrx.net.

No real purpose other than demo'ing the use of graph colouring and its application in something other than register allocation.

#### Isthmus

[Demo](https://tan.ge/) | [Repo](https://github.com/s1gtrap/isthmus)

A rushed attempt at a Hugo theme for my own personal website.

Hugo seemed like the go-to for statically generated homepages.
