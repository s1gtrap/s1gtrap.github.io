I have really come to appreciate Docker, on part because of the ease it brings for equalizing build environments among team members and collaborators, but especially after setting up a Raspberry Pi cluster for use as a home server. Specifically Docker Swarm, as it really goes a long way to building a somewhat fault tolerant home server.
