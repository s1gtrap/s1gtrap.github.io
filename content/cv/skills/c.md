C is a predecessor to my work with [Rust]({{< ref "/cv/skills/rust" >}}), as I have been working with C for over a decade by now. It is a natural precursor to both Rust and [C++]({{< ref "/cv/skills/cpp" >}}), as their memory models derive heavily from it.

While not featured directly in my portfolio, some close to ancient projects remain on my {{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c&sort=" >}}, but the reason this is rated so high is because of the aforementioned fact that its memory model lives on in most subsequent system languages.
