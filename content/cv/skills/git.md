Git is a core and central tool to my workflow, whether I'm collaborating or contributing to open-source, or documenting the changes made throughout development of personal projects. You can always take a look at my {{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap/" >}}, but one repository of note is {{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap/dotfiles" "s1gtrap/dotfiles" >}} that simplifies synchronizing my work environment across multiple devices (poor man's Nix).
