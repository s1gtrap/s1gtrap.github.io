TypeScript is a newer addition to my repertoire compared to [JavaScript]({{< ref "/cv/skills/js" >}}), but from mediocre experience a much needed step to improving development targeting web platforms with its static type checking, which is much appreciated compared to the so-called 'duck typing' of its JavaScript counterpart.

Featured in my portfolio is [Con2]({{< ref "/portfolio/con2" >}}), where both the front- and backend has been written in TypeScript. Another is [ts-nano](https://github.com/s1gtrap/ts-nano), which was an attempt at a text editor targeting the web comparable to Ace, although only intended for explicitly set highlights and nowhere near the same level of e.g. syntax highlighting.
