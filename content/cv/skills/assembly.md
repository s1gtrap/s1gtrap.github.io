While many classmates thought of assembly as a chore, I always appreciate working with low-level programming. I learned I had a real knack for it in the compilers course, so much so that I opted to continue that work in my [bachelors thesis]({{< ref "/cv/education/bsc" >}}) by implementing the register allocation that we skipped in the compilers course.
