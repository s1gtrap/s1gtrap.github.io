JavaScript is and has been a must for proficiency in web development, so naturally I'm fairly experienced working with this.

Although neither the end-product or source code is available, the primary project during my freelance gig for [Stagewise]({{< ref "/cv/employment/stagewise" >}}) has been with JavaScript in the form of cross-platform mobile app development with `react-native`.

Another web app that features in my portfolio, also made with the React framework, is [bad-directions]({{< ref "/portfolio/bad-directions" >}}) which has a demo available [here](https://tan.ge/bad-directions/).
