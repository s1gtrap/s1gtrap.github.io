Node.js was a natural progression from working with [JavaScript]({{< ref "/cv/skills/javascript" >}}) in the browser to working with JavaScript on the backend. Particularly front-/backend communication via HTTP has long been ingrained from my work with [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/), but more nice cases have also been covered with `WebSocket`s and raw bit manipulation.

### Examples

- [Con2]({{< ref "/portfolio/con2" >}}) ({{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap/con2" "frontend" >}}, {{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap/con2-api" "backend" >}})
- [`bad-directions`]({{< ref "/portfolio/bad-directions" >}})
