Go may not be featured in my portfolio currently, but has been used in my studies and in practice, in the [Distributed Systems and Security](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/120250/Distribuerede-Systemer-og-Sikkerhed) course and my employment at [Stagewise]({{< ref "/cv/employment/stagewise" >}}) respectively. The latter was in 2016 and was used to implement the backend of a mobile app, and the former was in 2022 where it was used to implement various security mechanisms and in the end have a working distributed ledger.
