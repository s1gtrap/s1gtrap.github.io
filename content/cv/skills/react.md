React as a framework for frontend development is my preferred way to enable user interaction in a sensible way. I started making single-page applets for fun with React.js towards the end of gymnasium, which landed me a gig at [Stagewise]({{< ref "/cv/employment/stagewise" >}}) working with `react-native` on a cross-platform mobile app (before hooks in 2016).

In the modern day, particularly with the addition of hooks resembling the functional paradigm, I still use React, driven by [Java-]({{< ref "/cv/skills/javascript" >}}) and [TypeScript]({{< ref "/cv/skills/typescript" >}}) alike. Additionally the Reactive paradigm has lead me to work with Yew and Dioxus, both web frameworks for the [Rust]({{< ref "/cv/skills/rust" >}}) environment targeting the browser through [WebAssembly]({{< ref "/cv/skills/wasm" >}}), the latter of which features server-side rendering, which pre-renders the initial state server-side and hydrates on `DOMContentLoaded` causing as close to a seamless experience on the web as possible.
