Rust has long been a favorite of mine and is naturally one of the first choices for development language.

As for the projects featured on my portfolio, [Dasha]({{< ref "/portfolio/dasha" >}}) and [Popeye]({{< ref "/portfolio/popeye" >}}), but there are many more featured on my {{< github "https://github.com/s1gtrap?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust&sort=stargazers" >}} profile.
