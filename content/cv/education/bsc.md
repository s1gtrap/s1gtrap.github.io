My bachelors project was an attempt at implementing a compiler backend that could translate a subset of LLVM to x86-64 assembly, and compare and evaluate different approaches to register allocation, including graph coloring, as used in ahead-of-time compilers like Clang, and linear scan, as used in just-in-time compilers like Java's JVM or .NET's CLR.
